1136340280.Ph.q.html	may the casimir effect be caused by a force between the plates usually the casimir effect experiment is described as two uncharged conductive plates placed facing one another in a deep vacuum when the space separating the two plates becomes narrow enough an attractive force appears between the plates the official explaination of this force is the limitation of creation of virtual particles between the two plates due to the heisenbergs uncertainty principle only allowing the emergence of particles with a wavelength being an integral fraction of the distance separating the plates so that the pressure of virtual particles is greater outside the plates than between them however as the plates are conductive it may be assumed that they are made up of metallic crystals consequently when the plates are close enough isnt it possible that the force binding metallic crystal atoms together also interacts between surface atoms of both plates hence an attraction interpreted as the casimir effect

1138979662.Ch.q.html	what is the actual freezing point of water temp i have a question about the freezing point of pure water it seems the more sources i check the more different answers i find i have always thought that pure water freezes at 0c or 32 f your site seems to support this your site also says that water with impurities freezes at a lower point here is why i ask for clarification i have found other information saying the exact opposite some sites have suggested that it is in fact impure or natural water such as lake or pond water that freezes at the above temps they suggest that the impurities in the water provide a seed around which ice crystals may form thus encouraging faster freezing the seeds are not in solution but rather suspension so that may be the difference between say salt and simple particles in the water but here is the kicker these sites go on to claim that pure water actually freezes well below these conventionaly thought of temperatures since the seeds that encourage freezing are absent my guess would be that pure water still freezes at oc or 32f but maybe not as quickly as water with paricles in suspension so maybe what these sites are telling us though poorly if true that in order to get pure water to freeze at the same rate as natual water with paricles in suspension the temp needs to be lower can you clear this up

1143146397.Es.q.html	why can we see circular rainbows hello sorry it wasnt a clear description so i will try again we have seen this several times now usually late springearly summer but that is probably because we have more free time to laze about each time it has been a bright day with clear blue skies the sun was high around 2pmish and we were looking up towards the sun the three rainbows were concentric they are stationary but there appears to be some distance between them as each ring looks quite a bit higher that the last but that could be an optical illusion the lower rainbow is very clear and it is difficult for me to guess the size as i was looking up the sun was slightly to the left of the top ring and the lower ring seemed to be larger than the size of the sun maybe twice the size or very slightly less all the colours of the rainbow were visible and bright in the first circle a little less bright in the second and feint but still visible with the naked eye in the third hope this helps barbara i live in the foothills of sierra nevada at 1014 meters asl the air is very clean here and the night skies are teriffic sometimes when conditions are right we can see three circular rainbows above each other getting smaller that appear to be some distance apart travelling upwards sort of a telescopic effect they seem to be very high above us and we have only seem them on very bright clear days why do we see these triple rainbows

1143146679.Ch.q.html	why dont chlorine gas bubbles rise when salt dissolves i understand that when salt dissolves in water the sodium and chlorine ions are broken by the charge of the water molecules and are surrounded by a shell of water molecules however i dont understand how the salt can retain its physical properties once the bonds are broken and the elements themselves are separated i know that on its own chlorine is a poisonous green gas and sodium is a highly reactive silvery metal if the bonds are being broken how is this a physical change i did a lab with my students in which we broke water into its elements by sending an electric current through the water the result was bubbles of oxygen and hydrogen rising to the surface how come it is different when the sodium chloride is broken does it have to do with the hydration i am a middle school science teacher in an international school in jakarta i have been teaching my students about solubility and have been driving myself crazy with this question the answer to which is sure to be maddeningly simple

1147726016.Ph.q.html	what would happen if you were to collide electrons i was thinking the other day and figured out something cool i think if you shoot two electrons at each other since they are point charges they will bounce off of each other without touching since the force between them would approach infinity as the distance between them approaches 0 right now my idea if you shoot 2 electrons parallel to each other there will be a magnetic attraction force this force would be proportional to the velocities of the electrons so i assumed that at some velocity the magnetic attraction force would be equal to the electric repulsion force than i took a step forward and said what if the electrons were shot even faster based on my current knowledge i would assume that since magnetic force and electric force are both inversely proportional to the square of the distance then even though the electric force would rise to infinity the magnetic force would do so aswell but even faster since it is initially greater at a given seperation distance so would the electrons then collide what would the result be has this been done before roman

1149069207.Es.q.html	do fluids in a rotating sphere have viscous energy losses as t goes to inf this came up in a dinner discussion with my father were both decently sure that a fluid encased in a rotating solid spherical shell will hit an equilibrium of sorts where everything moves at the same angular velocity about an axis im decently confindent that conservation of angular momentum should apply and after the sphere hits this equilibrium it will keep rotating without losses the problem that im having is that this equilibrium fundamentally involves a velocity gradient and that might introduce viscous losses in the rotating sphere this came up in a subset of discussion on the slowing of earths rotation is that due to viscous losses in the core im inclined to say no and that in fact the sun is pulling the iron core against one side of the earth effectively grinding the system otherwise in equilibrium to a halt but that this wouldnt happen if the suns gravitational pull isnt there this also seems like a plausible explanation for why one side of the moon is always facing the earth if the earths pulling of the core slowed down the rotation of the moon then wed expect it to only stabilize after the core and the near portion of the moons crust had the same angular velocity about the earth which means wed always see the same portion of the moons crust as it rotated about the earth

1149688379.Ph.q.html	how do free electron lasers work in details i did some research on this matter this is what i know or think i know electrons are shot through an array of magnets that cause the electron to fly in a something of a sinusoidal path the electron emits photons whenever it is accelerated acceleration is proportional to force on the electron which is proportional to the velocity of the electron since f qvb when photons get emitted the electron loses energy the only energy it could lose is kinetic so it gets slower which would lessen the force upon it by the magnetic fields which would lessen the acceleration which would lower the energy of the photon and thus lower the frequency so how is the light monochromatic and coherent here if there are different frequencies the only solution i could find is by making each magnet stronger then the previous also i had an idea why not instead of magnets why not use parallel negatively charges plates also why cant the frequency emitted of a free electron laser be in the long wavelength frequencies also is there a way to make a coherent parallel beam of radio waves similar to a laser but with much lower frequency radiation roman r

1149724447.Ph.q.html	whats the shadow like if 2 different lights shine on the object why i am asking in reference to 2 different light sources where one emits white light and the other emits coloured light i did an experiment with these conditions where the coloured light source was brighter and i found that the shadow of an object upon which both light sources shone seemed to be the complementary colour of the coloured light source eg where the light source was red the shadow was green i know that this was not an optical illusion because i photographed this situation covered everything in the photo except for the shadow and the shadow still appeared to be the complement however when just one coloured light source was used the shadow was just the same colour but darker i believe the answer has to do with additive colours of light

1151080691.Gb.q.html	whats the difference between a virus and a cancer cell this may sound like a bmovie scenario type of question which is why im asking it of course but ive always wondered if a supervillain in a james bond or mission impossible movie can threaten to infect the hero by injecting him with some horrible sort of plaguevirus couldnt he also threaten him with a slower death by injecting malignant cells from a cancerous tumor into his bloodstream with my limited knowledge of how cancer cells mutate multiply and spread to other parts of the body it would seem that like a virus these cells if transferred from a sick person into a healthy person could theoretically pass the cancer on if not why not are cancer cells that specific to the individual that the immune system of another person could easily kill them do malignant cells need to share the dna of the person its infecting in order to grow if so would a family member then be vulnerable say james bonds sick brother like giving a family member a kidney

1151417358.Ph.q.html	questions about electrons and photons when an electron bound to an atom absorbs or loses energy it moves to a higher or lower energy level is this movement between energy levels instantaneous or does it take a finite amount of time to complete the transfer my understanding is that electrons can only exist in discrete energy levels and not inbetween levels so what happens to the electron at the moment of energy gain does it simply vanish from the energy level it occupied and immediately reappear in another energy level or does it take a finite amount of time to make the transfer when an electron in atomic orbit absorbs gains energy from a photon how does the electron physically utilize this additional energy obviously the electron is a fundamental particle and will not change masschargespin etc so what realy does change from the electrons point of view im not referring to an energy level change which is the result of energy gain or loss im more interested in the physical processes that occur to the electron which eventually result in a level change is the exact mechanism understood by which a photon is created when an electron drops to a lower energy level how is the required exact energy extracted from the electron what mechanism extracts the energy from the electron and what mechanism creates the photon when is the photon created before the electron leaves the original level whilst the electron is between levels or when the electron appears in the new energy level how long does it take to create the photon is it instantaneous or does it take a finite time does the photon appear complete or does it have to be constructed so to speak how close is the photon to the electron when its created

1154223310.As.q.html	does light acquire and retain more redshift by passing thru a grav well mass bends light light is redshifted rsed due to distance recession velocity of source due to expansion of universe by gravity when emitted within a grav well moving to an area of lesser gravity where we are but can you specifically confirm that gravlensed light does not acquire and more importantly retain an additional rs amount on passing thru a gravity well having its path bent then continuing to us the observers my assumptions 1 the rsed light is from a distant galaxy is lensed by sun so we can get a measurable rs amount prior to lensing then potentially measure a change in its rs as sun passes by lensing it then measure galaxys rs afterwards we couldnt get beforeafter measurements using grav lensing by intervening galaxies 2 the light must come from a distant galaxy because milky way stars light does not have large enough rs to be measured by us w enough accuracy 3 suns light must be blocked so galaxys faint light could be detected passing by suns surface where grav lensing would be greatest the increase in the lights path length upon lensing by an object as close as the sun wouldnt be enough to increase rsing perceptibly so please dont focus on this in your reply im more interested in knowing if anyones definitively rejected the idea that merely passing thru suns or any grav well would add to a photons alreadyexisting rs value thanks andrew
1154223389.Ph.q.html	relative to a stationary observer how does a rod rotating near c appear one of the consequences of general relativity is length contraction in the direction of velocity the length contraction is also dependent upon the velocity considering a rod with one end fixed being rotated each point upon the rod has a different tangential velocity vrw wangular velocity from this it follows that for a rod rotating at such a high angular velocity that tangential velocities along it are near c relative to a stationary observer shouldnt each part of the rod contract a little differently specifically more and more towards the outer edges what would this look like also are there some sort of limits put on vrw such that for a rod of length r the limit of the angular velocity is cr or does this formula not apply in relativity thanks

1154531224.Ph.q.html	can wave function collapse actually be gravity or some unknown illusion this is actually sort of a twoparter i was reading up on quantum mechanics and particularly about the twoslit experiment i was looking into the theories on why photons seem to change depending on the observations and i came across the many worlds and the copenhagen interpretations but neither of these theories seem very convincing to me seeing as both make some extreme assumptions on how it can happen i was wondering if it was possible that the actual gravitational pull of the observing device could be pulling the photon towards a certain slit making it only move through one of them the second theory i had i though of when i was spinning a fly swatter in my fingers the ones with the twisted metal frame when your spinning the fly swatter it appears that the frame is coming out of the head remaking a new frame as it goes we know of course that this is just an illusion caused by the spinning if we didnt know better we would swear that new metal was forming out of the head so i also wondering if it was possible that what we think were seeing is actually an illusion caused by something we currently dont know of yet maybe the whole thing was always going through the one slit the whole time but an illusion was causing the appearance of a wave thank you for your time ev

1154617928.Ph.q.html	a theory of mass and gravity does it sound feasible i have a theory it explains why particles with mass resist acceleration imagine a massless charged particle based on newtonian physics applying a force on this particle will cause it to accelerate infinitely based on relativity this particle would accelerate infinitely quickly and stop at c i imagined this situation something caught my mental eye maxwell said that accelerating a charged particle causes a photon to be emitted a photon is a packet of energy energy is work which force distance so this means that in order to accelerate a charged particle a certain distance at a certain acceleration there must be a certain amount of force this shows that a charged particle massless particle just like a massive particle would resist acceleration so i theorized that objects have mass because they are made up of clumps of charged particles even the neutron which has a sum charge of 0 is still comprised of charged particles when you accelerate it it emitted photons but the photons that it emits cancel each other out i think this is a very neat answer to the question of why mass resists accel this opens up other things mass is energy mass is charges then charges are potential energy this actually sounds right too also if mass is charges then why would charges have an attraction we call gravity i figured that the charges are movingspinning in another dimension such as time how does this sound roman

1156019904.Gb.q.html	will identical clones given the same set of experiences behave the same ill use a computer analogy to clarify suppose you have two computers with the same identical hardware if you try to run the exact same set of software on them they should behave identically that is the way they process information is identical on the other hand two different computers say a mac and a pc will not handle the same software identically even though they may have the same amount of memory processing speed etc simply because their hardware cannot by the way it is structured and organized perform the exact same processes i imagine that genetically identical creatures if the entire set of their experiences were identical would also behave identically likewise i would think that if they each had been given a different set of experiences that they would still process those experiences in the same way that is to say that the most basic set of processes that occur at least those that are not shaped by experience to convert sensory stimulation into thoughts and ideas would be similar in the same way among geneticallyidentical creatures that would set them apart from geneticallydifferent creatures of the same intelligence in the words of the computer analogy two identical computers running completely different programs would still be distinguishable in the most basic processes involved in running those programs that would set them apart from two nonidentical computers of the same processing power is this true

1158765393.Ph.q.html	previously asked question and answer re electricity generation a few years ago after reading thru your archives for related material i asked you about the possibility of generating electricity per a dream that i had in which i saw long docks with lines connected to objects that looked rather like auto windshield wipers with round pieces of what looked like cork on the bottom floating in the ocean near the shore that were using the movement of the waves to generate electricity which was then collected via the docks i mentioned that in theory this would create a power source that would be nonpolluting and wondered why no one had actually attempted this before you sent me a very flippant answer that directed me to read your previous answers to questions about static vs other electricity which i had already done and found did not address my exact question telling me that this idea was not possible i have now read or heard from four different news sources that both england and the san francisco bay area plan to use the movement generated by waves and tides near their respective shores to generate electricity now i would like to know why this idea is viable for them and not when i said it you realize of course that had one scientist even really listened to me approx 6 years ago i could probably now enjoy benefits from the patent that i would have issued on my idea was it because i told you that the idea came to me in a dream that you put no store in it whatsoever did not einstein and other notable scientists confess that many of their most revolutionary ideas came to them in dreams further are not scientists like yourselves supposed to retain open minds that reach out beyond the known to grasp the world of possibility and even further how can one apply the label of scientist to themselves if they naysay every query that doesnt fit into that tiny box labeled what others have decided and im familiar with and nothing more

1159238414.Ph.q.html	concerning the construction of a cold flame as i understand it i click my butane torch and the spark ingites a selfsustaining reaction seen as a flame that is the fuel and the air are interacting and releasing lots of energy and the flame itself is the fuelair reactionary point some of the energy being released as lightphotons depending on the fuel changes the color of the flame and most of the released energy in the reaction is felt as heat hence the whole point of having a flame a focused point of change in heat therefor it should be possible to have the same reaction in reverse where a source mixture being reduced in energy would produce a flame where the reactionary particles therein would be changing state from its current temperature to a much lower temperature say their spin was slowed down and the inherent nature of the partice would be to spin at a particular speed and slowing it down caused the ambient heat particles to be sucked in to bring the particles back to their previous temperature how would you do it that is how would you do the same reaction in the other direction

1159449419.Ph.q.html	trajectories of surface objects if earth shrank to halfsize im seeking confirmation of my presumption that if earth instantly shrank to any radius less than its current radius all surface objects would then be in orbit and would circle the center of mass rather than the ns axis i presume that objects remain where they are on earths surface rather than sliding about because of rotation due solely to friction my shrinkage scenario would mean that the angular momentum of an object formerly located at 50 n 90 w would after shrinkage immediately would begin to describe a circular orbit around earths center of mass taking it down to the preshrinkage location of 50 s 90 e halfway around the planet and then up again to its former position at 50 deg n latitude etc assumptions earth shrinks instantly not gradually thus surface objects dont accompany the falling surface down to its new level earth is a perfect sphere and all orbits are perfect circles not ellipses no gravity from other celestial objects affects this system no atmospheric drag perfect vacuum prevails the same scenario could be accomplished i believe if the perfectly spherical earth didnt shrink but instead instantly became perfectly smooth and frictionless with no atmosphere if an oblate spheroid i think all objects in the two hemispheres would slide to their respective poles since gravity is greatest there thanks for your comments andrew

1161571639.Mb.q.html	will a plasmid like pgl2 be compatible with agrobacterium tumefaciens hi there i am a molecular biology student looking to perform a research project on transformation i have noticed kits from websites like wards that allow a student to transform a strain of e coli with the pgl2 plasmid the result is a strain of e coli that contains a gene that codes for luciferinase production which will produce a glow upon reaction with the chemical luciferin or another endogenous aliphatic aldehyde i would like to use this technology to create a transgenic plant instead of bacteria however i would like to create a plant that has the luciferinase gene so when it is watered with luciferin it will glow i know the addition of such a gene to plant is physically possible because there are pictures all over the internet glowing tobacco orchids etc of said experiments this gene addition is usually accomplished with agrobacterium tumefaciens i have been researching the similarities between several strains of e coli and a tumefaciens to see if perhaps the pgl2 vector will work in both but to no avail hence my question is will pgl2 work for both types of bacteria could i simply transform a tumefaciens instead of e coli with the pgl2 plasmid then insert the transformed agrobacter into a plant to produce a plant with the luciferinase gene

1161716231.Ph.q.html	to dave who replied to question 1161116212ph i see that when you synchronized the flow of atoms in the gas that allowed them to be in a way that when they produced a photon that allowed the waves to interact in a way that they were pretty much the same waveform but wouldnt this put the waveforms out of phase i read up on a article about free electron laser i think this is a very good idea because they are able to have more free standing electrons to contribute to the transfer of energy as well as if they are able to be more synchronized they can help keep the waveforms more coupled but i was thinking why there could not be a radioactive isotope low energy yield that provides the initial energy to be lase the problem you face is that the energy needs to be a synchronized waveform before it hits the electrons and the initial heat that the isotope gives off will cause the same initial problem could it be possibly sovled with some kind of wave guide will this question is posed in response to this answer httpwwwmadsciorgposts 1161177644phrhtml

1161961356.Ph.q.html	can something extremely heavy moving slowly cause serious damage im resubmitting my original question the source of the question is an argument about whether a rotating tank turret could a deliver deadly impact when colliding with a person standing still in the barrels path some of my friends claimed that being such an heavy object even when moving very very slowly the impact could still be lethal since the energy released depends on the mass and speed of the two colliding objects others said that the person being hit would just recoil and fall down causing the impact energy to disperse and preventing any actual damage from happening the same goes for a person standing on the tip of a peer would he be pushed by a very slow moving ship hitting him thus diminishing the damage of the impact im actually asking whether mass and speed are all there is to it when trying to predict the results of two objects colliding

1162310494.Eg.q.html	lack of reflection of large crack using ultrasound we have a surfacebreaking crack on a train axle which is made from aisi 1046 steel this crack is 7in long 10 micron wide and about 23 in deep it is transverse along the circumference of the axle and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis were having trouble detecting this crack using surface acoustic waves generated by laser ultrasonic ndt we have seen most of the incident wave reflect back from other cracks which are bigger however most of the incident wave transmitted through this crack this result is also the same as using surface waves generated by a contact transducer we tried with 500khz and 225 mhz contact transducer you may suggest that we use a high frequency contact transducer to see more reflected wave in addition i found a paper mentions that laser pulses on the order of 10 nsec generate ultrasound in the order of 10mhz frequency range we try laser ultrasonic at 6 nsec with energy at 700 mj and so we assume that this generated ultrosound that is close to 10 mhz frequency range and we are not satisfied with the amount of the reflected wave still the speed of the surface wave in the axle we get from a test is 2647ms so the wavelength for 500khz transducer is about 5000 micron the wavelength of 10 mhz range is about 265 micron you can see that the width of the crack which is 10 micron is much smaller than the wavelenghts of the ultrasound mentions above the coupling agent is just a common coupling for contact ndt im not sure what exactly off hand some research mentions that reflections of surface waves from small surface breaking crack is often weak and i know that the width of the crack shouldnt be smaller than half of the wavelenght or higher frequency is required however im very interested to know more in depth in theory of this issue i read the answer to the question of reflection of ultrasound from an air gap it mentions that the reflection intensity depends on the width of the gap that higher frequency results in higher reflection and that a gap at an integer multiple of half the wavelength excites the resonant and transmits the ultrasound or the resonant vanishes at higher order or bigger gap i assume however i dont see much explanation of how the reflected ultrasonic intensity increases as the thickness of a air gap gets smaller especially its smaller than half of the wavelength i would like to understand in theory why the ultrasound can transmit through an air gap when it gets smaller and in the case of its not an integer multiple of half the wavelenght i only observed the test so i dont have any graphs with me but ill see if i can get some graph for you anyway the reflection from this crack is not as high as we would like to see looking forward to your response tima

1164811457.As.q.html	frames of reference in angular rotation i am after some clarification to why isnt spin relative motion and how can i tell when it is happening frames of reference are arbitrary i can say i am sitting still in my chair but what i mean is that i am stationary relative to the earth under my feet but the earth is spinning around its axis at a rate of knots which is orbiting around the sun which is orbiting the center of our galaxy which is orbiting around the gravitational center of the local group of galaxies so depending on your perspective im either sitting stationary on my chair or hurtling through space at thousands of kilometres per second from my frame of reference i feel at rest there are no forces acting upon me yet if i rotate on my chair i can feel centripetal forces acting on my extremities theoretically if i spin fast enough my hands will fly off in the first example i feel like i am not moving because the earth and i are moving at the same rate i feel no movement because i am not accelerating the same is not true of spinning even if you are maintaining your rotational velocity you still feel centripetal force if i take my frame of reference i could say that the universe is spinning about me as i sit still on my chair but that doesnt stop my hands flying off the answer to this tends to start out with because you are spinning but this assumes a frame of reference relative to something else i am spinning relative to the earth and as discussed above frames of reference are arbitrary iow you could say object a is moving at 1ms relative to b or b is moving at 1ms relative to a however if a starts spinning 1000 times a second relative to b you cant say b is also orbiting a in the opposite direction at 1000 times per second because a feels centripetal force and b does not so whats solution

1170097384.Ph.q.html	why is matter scalable on earth but weightless in space the universe is filled with negative pressure supernova legacy team 2005 since negative pressure np is everywhere in the universe it must logically be in each earthly atom what must it be doing there but balancing the positive pressure pp which is in every atom it has to make newtons 3rd law true down to the atomic level which every vibrating action must logically require for an equal and opposite reaction newton could not have known what happens at the atomic level because np was discovered in 2005 over 300 years after his principia was published he appears to have been correct all the way with his 3rd law if the universe is filled with np then space too contains it everywhere throughout the vacuum yet everything is weightless in space each atom in the vacuum should logically contain np the same as all atoms do on earth so the questions arise if every mass within earths atmosphere contains np and pp to balance the 3rd law and it all has gravity and can be weighed why is everything weightless in the vacuum of space all space atoms must have pp because they are of the elements and the same everywhere is it possible that since everything is falling or orbiting at high speed in the vacuum that np can not unite with the pp in the atoms beyond a certain speed why else would matter have weight on earth but not in the great vacuum

1170636764.Bc.q.html	do noncompetetive inhibitors destroy the enzyme hi i am a little confused about the detail by which non competitive inhibitors work i know that non competitive inhibitors bind to an allosteric site and alter the structure of an enzyme in such a way that the active site is affected this should mean that the substate is no longer able to bind to the active site and no products can be formed now the confusion is that even in competitive inhibitors the active site is blocked and so the substrate is unable to bind to the enzyme preventing any reactions so why is it that only non competitive inhibitors give us a lower vmax whereas the vmax is unaffected in competitive inhibitors is it because competitive inhibitors are reversible and the subsrtate does eventually bind to the active site to carry out a reaction and that non competitive inhibitorscompletely destroy the enzyme so that there are less enzymes in the solution to which a substrate can bind and produce a product

1171077964.Ph.q.html	transformers how can e double and i halve i am having major difficulties understanding why in a 12 stepup transformer the voltage in the secondary doubles while the current halves i know and understand the simple equation piv that says this must be so and i know that if there are twice as many turns on the secondary than the primary then the voltage must double but try as i may i cannot picture in my mind what is happening at the electron level when you apply a field e to a noninductive circuit the entire body of freeelectrons within the wires begins to drift and this is what we call current doubling the strength of e will double the rate of drift of this electronfluid but in the 12 transformer example above the field e in the secondary which is an induced field has twice the strength as the field in the primary so why does not the electronfluid in the secondary drift with twice the velocity i know that i cannot look at the secondary in isolation and must consider the coupled system as a whole and i can see that if you had twice the voltage and current in the secondary you would be getting energy for nothing but for the life of me i cant picture this in my mind would appreciate it greatly if you could offer some insight or mental model that could help my understanding thankyou michael

1180054389.As.q.html	is the radius of the observable universe really 137 billion light years ive heard it said that the radius of the visible universe is 137 billion light years since the universe is 137 billion years old but doesnt this contradict itself we can only see an object that was 137 billion light years away if it was in that position 137 billion years ago but it wasnt all matter at the big bang was in a single point if all objects were moving apart at the speed of light then we would only be able to see objects 685 billion light years away as they were 685 billion years ago at this point in time the actual object that emitted the light back then would be 137 billion light years away so i guess you could say that we are seeing an object that at this point is that far away but the light we actually see is coming from much closer note since objects arent actually receeding at the constant speed of light this is slightly inaccurate but my point still comes across so if were measuring how far away those galaxies are right now yes it would be approximately 137 billion light years but were actually seeing the light from about 7 billion light years away so shouldnt the observable universe have a radius of just 7 billion light years heres a diagram i made to show my point httpi128photobucketcomalbumsp176japanada11observableuniverseswft1170091016

1189250132.Gb.q.html	can therapeutic cloning grow new blood vessels to treat arteriosclerosis i am a graduate law student currently writing about the international regulation generally and from a trade perspective of therapeutic cloning is my understanding of therapeutic cloning correct this involves transplanting a patients dna nucleus of a body cell into an unfertilized egg in order to grow stem cells which have the ability to become any type of cell in the body the nucleus of the egg cell is removed and after being shocked the egg will begin to divide so as to form an early stage embryo this embryo will have the same dna as the patient scientists can compel the stem cells to become the cells that they desire now my question tumour cells have the ability to stimulate the growth of blood vessels so could one possibly abuse these tumour cells for their ability to create new blood vessels so as to treat arteriosclerosis could therapeutic cloning engineer the artery cells so they contain this mechanism and thus grow new ones once current ones get blocked what would be the implication for the blood circulatory systembody questionanswer applied to trade if this technology would work would a company produce a drug that allows the creation of new blood vessels on the basis of this mechanism or would the medical professional transplant these engineered cells after all this is done with bone marrow transplantation ie blood stem cells could this ability to create new blood vessels also be reversed slightly so that maybe nonvital blood vessels are temporarily inactivated as opposed to allowing blood flow this could be of use for surgeries in that only inner blood vessels have blood going through them many thanks for your very appreciated answer

1198897487.Ph.q.html	followup question for john linkreuncertainty in the topic zero hi john link well lets first focus our attention on example 2 suppose we set the middle of the plank to be the origin and positive to the right in this case we can get rid of the mass of the plank regardless of its existence in this case it follows that 05 f_2 2 mg 0 and f_2 mg 0 or f_2 mg we are assuming that the mass of the plank is 0 if we substitute mg for f_2 into the first equation we have 05 mg 2 mg 0 which has no solution except 0 that implies that we can never assume that mass of the plank to be 0 is my reasoning correct so far if so i think it is this paragraph that confuses me if the mass of the plank on which the cat is standing is assumed to be zero the plank will always tip because there will be no torque to oppose the torque due to the cat my analysis shows that this situation ie the tipping of the plank will never happen if the mass of the plank is assumed 0 and the mass of the cat 0 however the plank does tip if the mass of the cat 0 funny isnt it since the equation does not have any real solution except 0 and the mass of the cat is not assumed to be 0 as for the torque i think there really is one torque due to f_2 or the force of the right sawhorse this is equivalent of the equation 05 f_2 2 mg 0 in terms of torque and assuming both f_1 and mg 0 m mass of the plank and f_2 mg m mass of the cat which turn out to be no real solution except 0 for m what do you think did you misinterpret the question thank you for the help and time and i really appreciate it

1198967850.An.q.html	is there a known phenomenon wherein pulse rate increases on inspiration and decreases on expiration i swim for exercise and have noticed that even when not swimming my pulse rate seems somewhat higher when air is flowing in than when it is flowing out this may be a consequence of the fact that swimming does restrict when you can take a breath or maybe not or perhaps the body knows that more oxygen is available with new air and less with used air and thus modifies the heart rate appropriately the effect is not huge and is difficult to quantify as it only occurs over a short time period one respiratory cycle or about 23 seconds per fast and slow phase for the pulse btw im an emt so the answering expert may feel free to let loose with technical terminology if desired if i dont know what it means ill look it up

1199377646.Ph.q.html	followup question rod tension wire and a person the original question was a 470kg uniform rod 425 m long is attached to a wall with a hinge at one end the rod is held in a horizontal position by a wire attached to its other end the wire makes an angle of 300 deg with the horizontal and is bolted to the wall directly above the hinge if the wire can withstand a maximum tension of 1450 n before breaking how far from the wall can a 680kg person sit without breaking the wire answer 315 m you quoted in your reply start with the fact that the torques around the pivot add to zero there are three torques the torque due to the tension in the wire the torque due to the rods mass and the torque due to the mass of the person on the rod torque is calculated as the product of a force and the length of a moment arm so you will have to work out forces and moment arms if i tell you more than that i will be working the problem for you so go from there ok here is what i think about first both the net force and net torque must equal to 0 there are three forces positive to right and up mg the person weight the tension in the wire 1450sin30 n for ycomponent 1450cos30 n for xcomponent and the weight of the rod mg with m 140 kg so the sum of both x and and ycomponents must equal to 0 in order for the system to stay in static equilibrium both weights of the person and the rod have only ycomponent thats it xcomponent 0 the only xcomponent of the system of the xcomponent of the tension in the wire does that mean the xcomponent of the tension also 0 i thought that it should be 1450cos 30 n i am a little confused by this paradox for the torque the net torque also must equal to 0 let the xcoordinate of the perso be x which is what we are solving for so the torque caused by the person is mgx with x the moment arm and the point on the wall attached to the rod be the origin the center of mass of the rod is 4252 m so the torque caused by the rod is 47g4252 nm the torque caused by the tension in the wire is 1450sin30425 nm i think this is only for the y component should there be a torque for the xcomponent i dont think so but not able to give a specific reason

1199477165.Eg.q.html	electricity concepts related to ohms law and electric potential i recently saw a show on tv called mad labs in which they tested the electricity that apples and oranges produce by sticking electrodes into the fruits they found apples gave a higher voltage reading 30 v while oranges gave a lower one 29 v however voltages are only a measure of electric potential and oranges were found to give a higher current not using an ammeter but rather by touching the electrodes with the tongue it prompts me to wonder of several things im embarrassed because im actually studying at undergraduate level but these things genuinely confuse me 1 ohms law states that v ir if the oranges give a lower voltage reading but produce a higher current does that mean that the resistance of the oranges is lower if so in what forms do the resistance come in they were measured using the same wires of the same voltmeter 2 30 v is a high voltage reading they connected a large number of apples in series by the way normal dry cells range from 15 v to 15 v but voltage is related to current and not exactly the total charge that a power source can produce i know that apples are not able to do things like lighting a flashlight for extended periods unless we use many many apples because the amount of charge that can be produced by apples is less than that of dry cells is there any way to determine whether a voltage source can produce a larger total charge are there any equations that relates to this 3 if the apples were to be used for any electrical work am i correct to say that eventually when no more electricity can be produced the apples will give a voltage reading of 0 v thanks

1202480594.Ph.q.html	find the force that the person must exert on the plank if he only lift it o suppose there is a uniformly rectangular plank with length 2 m width 1 m and mass 3 kg a person lift up the plank in one of its end center of the width but i know its impossible for a hand to be a point how much force must he exert what is the minimum force and average force he can exert i know the center of mass is at the point 105 with the length being the xcoordinate and width ycoordinate if the person lift up the plank at that point would he be able to exert the same minimum force is it true that the force that the person exert is simply the torque weight of the plank times distance from the center of mass i dont think so since if the person lift the plank at the center of mass the torque would be 0 since the distance is 0 when a person lifts something up is it always heshe would exert the minimum force to lift that up if so we dont have to state minimum force in the question but just the force the person would exert since heshe would always exert the minimum force if the person does not lift the plank at the center of the width at the far end of the plank but the end of the width instead how to calculate the force at that case this is just curiosity

1205759280.Ph.q.html	why is time relative this is what ive heard you have 3 objects a b c mass a b and c a and b b is closer too c than a from what ive heard from as perspective b looks as though is moving slower through time due to the gravity of c or from bs perspective a is moving faster through time velocity of b a which would mean that from bs perspective a is moving slower through time or from as perspective b is moving faster through time i thought that gravity gave a mass an acceleration if a mass is accelerating faster and faster the closer it gets to a massive object wouldnt the effects of time speeding up due to speed and time slowing down due to the mass cancel out ive also heard that if a mass moves faster and faster toward the speed of light it gains mass does time slow down when a mass gains more mass do the experiments weve done take into account that the mass being accelerated isnt being accelerated toward a mass but at a set distance from one
1205760474.As.q.html	could this be an answer to the solar corona problem this was something i wrote for my blog and i want to be proved wrong because the answer seems logical but i know that im not logical and more over most of the time i have no idea what im talking about but this allows me to gain more knowlegde from my mistakes please give me some insight i feel like there is something people are forgetting stars at times give birth to black holes they are very similar in what they do when black holes interact with the environment around them for example by drawing gas from an orbiting star the gas heats up to intese tempuratures this is if im not mistakencaused by the radiation produced from the particles moving at such a fast speed a black holes gravity is so great that it creates an amazing curvature which traps even light now the question i ask is can the curvature of the sun be held accountable for the coronas tempurature we all know that we orbit around the sun we know it and most of us love it most of us know that is because of the gravitational pull of the sun some of us know that high gravity can effect space curvature so can the gravitional curvature be held responsible for the plasma that is the corona slowly rotation black holes have something called a photon spherethis photon sphere is similar to a coronain the sense that both are very hot and both are trapped because of gravity created by a massive object now if that is not enough to answer the question i have additional input if the temperature doesnt fit a mathmatical proof i cant write could the inclusion of friction close the gap and if not thatthen could the strange magnetic field finish it

1208179733.Ph.q.html	would a helicopter rotor work in a ducted fan type of configuration i would like to know if helicopter rotor would work if enclosed horizontally similar to how a propellor can be enclosed in a ducted fan type of setup ive read another article on here which talked about the perils of flying a helicopter in a tight tunnel but im wondering if the setup was such that it was completely open above and below the rotors if this would work the simplest way to describe this is to imagine two pie tins with one turned upside down place them on top of each other remove a portion of the center connect those inside edges and place the rotor inside of that hole where the ends of the rotor blades are very close to the sides would a setup like that work or would this be too inherently unstable and hard to control to be safe thanks dean

1209920002.Ph.q.html	why is there no wavelength associated with a 1s2s1s2 in he i para spectrum i was looking at the spectrum of neutral helium apparently helium has two atomic states which give rise to two nonmixable spectrums called the ortho and the para in the para spectrum there is a sequence of transitions that involve the transition of electrons from the 1snp orbitals to the 1s2 ground state which begins with the wavelength 584a there is another which involves the transition of electrons from the 1snp orbitals to the 1s2s n234 which begins with 20586a the problem i have is that there is no wavelength associated with a 1s2s to 1s2 transition i would assume that the shape of each is spherical with the 2s being larger the reason i am looking at this in detail is because i am interested in the accepted electron configuration model and how it explains helium i find the idea that excited electron states involving the p orbitals have a choice of which state to fall into it is disconcerting that these two should be disconnected where in theory an electron which makes a transition to a 2s needs to go back up before it can fall to the ground state perhaps i am confused between the concepts presented in bohrian terms and those that are now generally accepted your insight would be appreciated thank you sean

1211289219.Ph.q.html	where does the energy for gyroscopic precession come from i have a few unanswered questions about gyroscopic precession i looked thought the archive but i havent found anything that directly answers my question i understand if you spin up a gyroscope put it down at an angle its axis will precess around in a cone i further understand and correct me if i am wrong about this that in a completely frictionless environment it will precess forever around its center of mass this strikes me as similar to a spinning an object in space spin it once and it goes forever baring friction and outside influence however in the case of the gyroscope where does the initial energy come from to start in precessing does it tilt slightly more upon release thereby lowering its center of mass and make use of some potential energy does the gyroscope itself reduce speed slightly if we assume one of these things is true than it would seem the energy would have to go somewhere once the gyroscope stops precessing for instance say we built a half circular frictionless tack that is the correct height such that it supports the gyroscope once it gets to it without lifting it now when the gyroscope reaches the track it should stop precessing because there is no longer a tilting force applied to it however if the gyrocope initially derived energy for precession from a slight drop or a decrease in rotation does the reverse happen it would seem that it could not rise back up because then it would then have a tilting force again does the gyroscope gain rotational speed

1222395342.Ph.q.html	how does radio wave absorbtion work in mri for my hsc course there are limited sources offering the information i need my problem is that my sources contradict eachother both are similar in that they explain how the radio frequency matches that of the hydrogen protons and that protons absorb the incident wave and all begin to precess in phase with each other one source though explains once in phase the nuclei will stay in phase until the external radio pulse is turned off the nuclei now start to lose energy they go out of phase and release a radio frequency signal at their larmor frequency the radio receiver detects these while the other source states although the nuclei are precessing they will not be doing so in phase in time as a result there will be no net transverse across the external field magnetism a pulse of radio waves at the larmor frequency will force the precessing nuclei to do so in phase ie they all precess together this means that they will have a net transverse magnetism component which rotates the precessing transverse magnetic field is in effect a changing field it will induce a small ac emf in a receiving coil this emf will have the same frequency as the precessing nuclei ie the larmor frequency so one sates the radio wave is reemitted after the pulse turns off while the other states the radio wave is reemitted while the pulse is on which one is correct thankyou very much for taking the time to read my question

1237241339.Ph.q.html	if a rifle is calibrated when level is it only accurate on level ground the following question was asked on a radio science showif you calibrate your rifle to shoot a certain distance and then move to a shooting range where the target is at the same distance but on a slope will you hit the target the answer the host gave you will always aim too high a firearm is sighted based on the distance between the barrell and the ground if you shoot up or down you are changing that reference point so you will miss your target the solution would be to lower the sight my answer was intuitively you might think that if the rifle is calibrated on level ground it would undershoot a raised target and overshoot a target on a downward slope but the only force that pulls the bullet down is gravity and the effect of gravity is the same regardless of whether the target is level raised or lowered in other words no matter where the target is the bullet drops the same amount because of gravityand hits the target who is correct

1243295385.Bt.q.html	questions about plant electrical conductivity and mythbusters what caused the results of the mythbusters plant perception test i know it is unlikely that plants have emotions or can experience physical sensations but im curious as to what could have caused the mythbusters to get the results they did when they tested plants for perception using a polygraph in episode 8 of season 6 episode 61 overall of their show httpkwcorgmythbusters200609episode_61_deadly_straw_primarhtml even when the plant and polygraph were inside the shipping container and they were outside the plants electrical conductivity still seemed to change when tory thought about hurting it what could have caused such a result and why would the factor that caused it have always coincided with tory thinking about the plant why would plant conduct more elec if hit or sprayed with fire extinguisher in episode 61 of the mythbusters they sprayed a plant with a fire extinguisher that was hooked up to a polygraph and found a huge spike in its electrical conductivity its recorded electrical conductivity also increased when they hit the plant why would this happen

1243523022.Ph.q.html	could the rate of passage of time be a function of time since the big bang i have checked the archives one question does refer partly to this idea the response did not answer it i would like to know what evidence we have that the rate of passage of time is not a function of the time since the big bang gr tells us that the rate of time is dependent on the spacetime curvature however what if independently from this the rate of passage of time is compressing possibly linearly universally throughout the universe the effect would only have to be very small to account for the redshift and time duration of standard supernovae in other words i am wondering if the observations that are used to calculate the rate of expansion of space could also be explained by time compression since the universe was all connected at the time of the big bang there is no problem with the universal clock starting with the same rate and changing at the same rate since the effect i am querying is universal and small any attempt to measure it locally would fail as all clocks would modify together independent of the additional effects caused by gravitation and velocity however at large distances one seconds worth of wavelengths for a particular atomic spectral line would by the time it reached us now appear to contain fewer wavelengths because our observer second would be shorter my simple calculations show that this would lead to a nonlinearity of the hubble constant with distance and i believe a nonlinearity has been observed since it is all relative i see no reason why an asymtotic compression of time could not continue for an infinite time just for clarity for what i am suggesting the measured number of wavelengths for a particular spectral line would always give the same result no matter when it occurred after the big bang provided they were measured close to the observer and there were no realtive velocity or acceleration

1247279672.Ch.q.html	how to calculate the internal pressure of a closed container as its heated i am trying to understands what involves in the calculation of internal pressure for a closed container which is half filled with water and the other half is filled with inert gas from understanding without inert gas the internal pressure will be generated from the vapor pressure of water and possibly the henry law p kc of air however since there exist inert gas is p nrtv the correct equation to use for the pressure from the inert gas in both cases what would the volume be as the temperature increased the water volume could possibly increased thus shrinking the space for the inert gas however gas expands as the temperature increased meaning that the volume for inert gas also increased as temperature increased i am quite confused with this and hope to get advice on this matter thanks a lot

1247590417.Ph.q.html	questions about time travel i know that we can find our time slowing factor using the equation 1 sqrt 1 vc that means that time will slow down a little bit every time you move do you think that a person will live longer and age less if they are constantly moving not considering other variables a good example would be an airline pilot since they move faster than normal over many years of course this may only extend their life by a week or day then again because of what i mention later it may not matter continuing this does the above equation take into consideration that the earth is also moving would we age slower if we were on a faster moving planet and does that depend on how fast the earth is rotating around the sun or how fast it is revolving around its axis or both since time can be influenced by gravity i have read that time goes slower the closer you are to earths core does that mean that time goes slower in a submarine can these people technically live longer timewise and how does time slow down for them and because of this wouldnt that led to airplane pilots aging faster thus balancing out what they gain by air travel its a little overwhelming for me thank you in advance for all your help

1254321307.Me.q.html	xrays effect on bone and soft tissue cells xrays are electromagnetic waves in simple terms they are waves of energy when an xray wave collides with a bones atom the atom absorbs the energy and shoots out an electron as a result of this energy absorption the atom that lost the electron will eventually receive and replace the electron lost from the surroundings nevertheless this procedure of replacing the electrons for all the atoms of the bone that lost electrons will take time and this is reason that there has been a recuperation period that has been put in place by health organizations till a second xray procedure can be done the reason for this recuperation period being established is because an xray can collide with soft tissues atoms causing them to ionize the same way the bones atoms do if this ionization takes place in a body these ions can do damage in cells if only a little damage happens being a low radiation over a long period of time the body repairs the damage done however as you increase the radiation and shorten the time the cells in your body can not repair all the damage these damaged cells will then multiply causing skin cancer these events can also occur with the bone cells hi i am wondering if the above is correct and if not if you could explain it to me thnx so much

1255183536.Ph.q.html	how can energy be lost during energy conversions at school i did a simple classroom experiment to demonstrate how gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy when a dynamics trolley of a certain mass is released from the top of a ramp the speed of the dynamics trolley as it moved down the ramp was detected using speed sensors after completing the experiment i did some calculations to determine the gravitational potential energy of the trolley at the start of the experiment at the top of the ramp before being released and the kinetic energy it had as it passed through the speed sensors i then used these 2 figures to work out the efficiency of the transfer of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy i found from my calculations that the conversion was not 100 efficient my question is how was energy lost during this conversion was this energy lost due to friction between the wheels of the dynamics trolley and surface of the ramp if this is the case was this energy lost in the form of heat energy did this friction cause both the wheels of the trolley and the surface of the ramp to gain heat or just one of the aforementioned where does this heat energy then go is it simply lost to the surroundings or can it somehow be usefully reusedrecycled i also wonder whether energy could have been lost during the conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy due to air resistance i believe that air resistance can reduce the speed of a moving object thus it is useful to streamline the shape of a racing car but am unsure whether this effectively reduces its amount of kinetic energy would one or both of these factors any others be responsible for the inefficient conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy if in fact air resistance is also a reason for energy loss what happens to this lost energy is it perhaps lost as heat energy and warms the surroundings thank you

1256440238.Ph.q.html	what limits the resolution of a light microscope i struggle immensely with understanding optics how they work in light microscopy i have looked through the archives and although there are some questions answered that relate to my question i am still unable to thoroughly understand all the reasons for why resolution is low in a microscope that uses light i would be incredibly grateful for some feedback on what i have written below as i am still unsure whether i understand correctly the resolution of a light microscope is restricted by the long wavelength of light this is because objects eg many cell organelles smaller than the wavelength of light produce large diffraction patterns that interfere with each other when they obstruct the light waves cause them to bend around them this not a problem with larger objects as those that are larger than the wavelength of light produce smaller diffraction patterns the size of the objective lens is also a problem as although it is larger than the wavelength of light small diffraction patterns still occur when light is passing through refracting this causes some blurring the refractive index of the material of the lenses the air light passes through between the specimen objective lens further affect resolution the numerical aperture of the objective lens is another resolution restrictor for a light microscope light diffracts in a particular way when passing through a glass cover slip into air which means only certain lens numerical apertures with specific refractive indexes can then be used to collect it resolution is increased by increasing the numerical aperture of the objective however there is a limitation to how much it can be increased for a light microscope because of the refractive index of the air that the light passes through before reaching the objective and that particular way it causes light to diffract when entering it after passing through a cover slip already stated above

1260282904.Ph.q.html	how do colliders create particles popular press and accessible science reporting frequently explain that colliders of increasing energy andor luminosity are needed in order to detect or discover new particles i understand roughly massenergy equivalence so i get why higher energies are needed for more massive particles as a scientist from a different field bio and cs what i dont grasp is why highenergy collisions happen to create particles in the first place i think my confusion can be broken down into two questions 1 what is it about creating a highenergy collision that causes new particles to spontaneously appear 2 do the laws of physics somehow guarantee that all particles can be created this way or is it possible that particles exist which simply cant be created as a result of a collision regardless of the collision energy it makes intuitive sense to me that smacking particles together could tear them apart and allow us to see their constituents ie two colliding protons could impact with enough energy to unbind them allowing us to observe free up or down quarks streaking away from the collision with high energy it also makes sense that in the collision charged particles are accelerated causing photons of various energies to be emitted i dont get why colliding two protons would cause say a top quark or a higgs boson to suddenly appear as if from nowhere

1262873240.Ph.q.html	what law tells which atoms to move during length contraction i believe i understand the theory but it made me think of a scenario i connot resolve consider a ruler the length of which is one lightyear if it were accelerated to very near the speed of light along the direction of its length according to the theory its length would become very near zero however where along the original length of the ruler would the near zero length mass of atoms congregate would it be at the leading end of the ruler the trailing end or somewhere in between regardless if the acceleration occurred in any passage of time totaling less than half a year at least a portion of the atoms comprising the ruler would need to travel faster than the speed of light to get there thereby violating einsteins special relativity postulate that nothing can exceed the speed of light beyond this what law of naturephysics dictates which atoms would need to move to the supposed congregation point conversely say that instead of a single ruler one lightyear in length there are roughly thirtyone quadrillion foot long rulers laid end to end enough to equal one lightyear in total length and that those were accelerated to very near the speed of light would there be roughly thirtyone quadrillion near zero length masses of atoms spread out of the distance of a lightyear would the answer change if each of the rulers had magnets on both ends and were thereby linked to each other

1274150137.Ev.q.html	why are certain diseases inherited hence genetic hello please excuse my poor english wikipedia states that natural selection is the process by which certain heritable traitsthose that make it more likely for an organism to survive and successfully reproduce become more common in a population over successive generations moreover i have gathered from this very site that natural selection is believed by the overwhelming majority of biologists to be the main drive for evolution among living organisms therefore i am asking myself 1 why do genetic diseases exist or should i say seem not to disappear 2 does it mean human beings given a relatively similar environment on a long period of time will attain perfection for that given environment that being said im also wondering why biologists never talk about gene pool ratios that is so i put it the proportion of a specific gene pool compared to another it would be a useful concept in the determination of the genetic evolution of a people supposing it had to go through frequent processes of interbreeding with geneticallydifferent peoples i mention that concept because i believe it might be as important as natural selection itself ill use an example say 10 type a men live in a very hot climate and have evolved so as to be efficient and adapated to that environment then say 10000 type b men adapted to colder climates settled after a long travel among type a men and mixed doesnt it seem obvious that on the middleterm type b traits will prevail to such an extent that type a traits will be wiped out and that certain adaptative wonders developed by type a men might never reappear hence indicating that gene pool ratios have as much importance if not more importance as the concept of natural selection thank you for answering me frederic

1283206018.Im.q.html	mhc reponses to erythrocyte antigens vs protein antigens note to expert two versions of this question were submitted by the same person i have included both here because they are asking different questions about the same topic sm question1 i have found some reference to the k and b haplotype in some papers but am not sure what it means i have found that mice with both the k and b haplotype have similar responses to erythrocyte antigens this was determined using the haemagglutination test but mice with k haplotype were able to respond to protein antigens while the b haplotype was unable to my guess is that answer lies in relation to the mhc class i and mhc class ii responses maybe mhc class i is responsible for the erythrocyte antigens while mhc ii is responsible for the protein antigens also the mouse with the b haploytype is missing the ealpha h2 complex does this relate to its response to the protein antigens question 2 what is the difference in the immune response to erythroctye antigens eg sheep red blood cell in mice and protein antigens eg hen egg lysozyme in mice i have found some reference to mhc haplotypes and one strain of the mice was haplotype b while the other two types were haplotype k what does this mean the strain of mice with haplotype b were also deficient in the ealpha h2 complex the two mice with the k haplotype were able to produce antibodies that were responsive to both the sheep red blood cell and the hen egg lysozyme the mice that were of the haplotype b could produce an antibody response only to the sheep red blood cells this was tested using the haemagglution test while the antibody response to hel was tested using an elisa my best guess is that the response to the sheep red blood cell was mediated by igm which suggests that the response is mhc ii independent if this is case why is igm the most effective antibody in responding to foreign erythrocytes in regards to the hel antigen igm was not effective in respondinghence an mhc ii dependent response is necessary in order to induce class switching why is this so
